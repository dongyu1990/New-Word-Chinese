1. Project Overview
-------------------

The initial idea of the new word detection is inspired by Chinese 2012 COAE tasks, we find it is hard to detect new word in weibo using existing methods. So a new way of new-word-detection is needed. Here we use general suffix tree to solve this problem, which can efficently statistic the number of LCP (longest common phrase).


2. Installation instructions
-------------------

Using a Visual Studio 2010 could help much in installation. if you are only for test and simply use. just download or clone it and open the solution file.


3. User Guide
-------------------

using the project is simply and convenient. 
   
   1、in /output/ delete all files in this directory.
   2、make sure your file is in GBK and use *.py(in /preprocess) to preprocess the file you want to find the new word. get the output file and name it as A
   3、move A to /input directory
   4、change the GST.cpp file, in line 264,change the input file to A
   5、run and wait to see the output directory.
